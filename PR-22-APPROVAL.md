# Pull Request #22 Approval Review

## Decision: APPROVED âœ…

## PR Details
- **Title**: Revert "Feature/bandera emiratos arabes unidos" Corruption
- **PR Number**: #22
- **Author**: ForLess01
- **Status**: Open
- **Changes**: Removes 31 lines from script.js

## Review Summary

This pull request is **APPROVED** for merge. The PR correctly reverts corrupted code introduced in PR #10.

## Analysis

### Issues Identified in Current Code
The current `script.js` file contains critical code corruption:

1. **UAE Flag Implementation (lines 2609-2630)**
   - References undefined variables: `red`, `blue`, `pushRect`
   - The function signature and variable declarations don't match the implementation
   - Variables are declared but then different code tries to use them incorrectly

2. **Niger Flag Implementation (lines 2659-2672)**
   - Contains code using UAE-specific variables (`redW`, `red`, `green`, `black`) that are undefined in the Niger flag context
   - These variables don't exist in the Niger flag scope

3. **Orphaned Code (lines 2674-2681)**
   - Code fragments that appear to belong to Niger flag implementation are placed outside the proper function context
   - This creates syntax errors and broken functionality

### Why This Revert is Necessary

The revert removes these 31 lines of corrupted/broken code, which will:
- Restore `script.js` to a working state
- Remove undefined variable references
- Eliminate syntax errors
- Allow the repository to function correctly

### Recommendation

**Merge this PR immediately** to fix the code corruption. After merging, if the UAE flag feature is still desired, it should be re-implemented properly with:
- Correct variable scoping
- Proper function structure
- Testing to ensure no corruption
- Review to catch such issues before merge
